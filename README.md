I'm Nash Honold and I recently graduated with my CS degree (Summer, 2023). 
My most comfortable language is Java but I have explored other languages and tools such as Python, C++, SQL, VBA, Powershell, and others. I have created some tools to automate and simplify some tasks with my current employer but am unable to keep a repository here for those. I have been introduced to neural networks, database design, as well as cybersecurity and am currently exploring Arduino microcontrollers. This GitHub is for me to store my school projects as well as any personal projects I may be working on.

If you would like to reach me please email me at nashonold@gmail.com
