ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, 

I'm Nash Honold and I'm currently in my Senior year of my CS degree and cannot wait to break into the tech field. 
Im in my 4th year of coding in Java and am constantly exploring other technologies such as Python, C++, SQL, VBA, Powershell and others. I have recently been introduced to neural networks, database design, as well as cybersecurity. This github is for me to 
store my school projects as well as any personal projects I may be working on. Admittedly I am terrible at keeping this repository up to date!

If you would like to reach me please email at nashonold@gmail.com
