ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, 

I'm Nash Honold and I'm currently in my Junior year of my CS degree and cannot wait to break into the tech field. 
Im in my 2nd year of coding in Java and am constantly flirting with Python when I get the time. This github is for me to 
store my school projects as well as any personal projects I may be working on.  

If you would like to reach me please email at nashonold@gmail.com
